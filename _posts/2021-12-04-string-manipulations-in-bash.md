## Introduction

When working in the software industry, no matter you are a software engineer, a
data scientist, a support enginner, or any other roles, you probably need to
know some basic skills about Bash to
improve your productvity. This can be useful for automating complex tasks in
your terminal, generating file for configuration or documentation, sharing a
command with your teammates, etc. In this post, we are going to explore some
frequently used techniques about string manipulations.

After reading this article, you will understand:

* How to declare a variable?
* Some general concepts
* Some specific concepts to dig deeper
* How to go further from this article

Now, let's get started!

## Declaring Variables

**Declare a single line variable.** To declare a single line variable, just
declare a variable, followed by an equal sign (`=`) for the assignment, and ends
with the value of the variable, either using a string directly, or using a
command inside a subshell (`$(...)`):

```sh
content="Hello Bash"
creation_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d") # 2012-12-04
```

**Declare a multi-line text.** A heredoc is a special-purpose code block that
tells the shell to read input from the current source until it encounters a line
containing a delimiter. EOF (end of file) is a commonly used delimiter but it's
not mandatory. You can use JSON, YAML, TEXT, or any other delimiter that you
think relevant for your situation. The syntax for Heredoc in Bash is:

```sh
COMMAND << DELIMITER
Here is the long description
...
DELIMITER
```

Here is an example for generating a YAML file, where we generate the heredoc and
print it inside a subshell
and assign the result to a variable:

```sh
content=$(cat << YAML
cluster:
  type: $TYPE
  name: elasticsearch-$TYPE
  date: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
YAML
)
```
