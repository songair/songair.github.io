## Introduction

Explain context here to attract people's attention... like:
- topic: what you want to talk about?
- audience: who are you targeting?
- motiviation: why is it interesting for them? Or why is it important to understand this topic?

After reading this article, you will understand:

* The structure of different deciders
* Some general concepts
* Some specific concepts to dig deeper
* How to go further from this article

Now, let's get started!

## Responsibility

* What are they responsible for?
* Which actions require decisions?

## Deciders Structure

In Elasticsearch 7.16, there are 19 deciders for the shard allocation. You can
find them as follows:

```
âžœ  elasticsearch git:(v7.16.2 u=) rg -l --sort-files "extends AllocationDecider" server/src/main | sed 's/.*\///g'
AllocationDeciders.java
AwarenessAllocationDecider.java
ClusterRebalanceAllocationDecider.java
ConcurrentRebalanceAllocationDecider.java
DiskThresholdDecider.java
EnableAllocationDecider.java
FilterAllocationDecider.java
MaxRetryAllocationDecider.java
NodeReplacementAllocationDecider.java
NodeShutdownAllocationDecider.java
NodeVersionAllocationDecider.java
RebalanceOnlyWhenActiveAllocationDecider.java
ReplicaAfterPrimaryActiveAllocationDecider.java
ResizeAllocationDecider.java
RestoreInProgressAllocationDecider.java
SameShardAllocationDecider.java
ShardsLimitAllocationDecider.java
SnapshotInProgressAllocationDecider.java
ThrottlingAllocationDecider.java
```

Among these deciders, there is a root decider, the `AllocationDeciders`, which
asks all other deciders to decide for the shard allocation. As you can see from
the file name, they are for awareness key-value pairs (such as availability
zone), cluster rebalancing, concurrent relabalancing, disk threshold, and much
more.

## Making Decisions

* Structure of the decisions
* Processing mode (fetch-then-process)
* When are the decisions made?

## Lifecycle

_When are deciders created? I.e. where are deciders positioned in the lifecycle of
an Elasticsearch cluster?_

When starting a new node, the class `Bootstrap` is called. Before starting the
node, it creates a new `Node` instance, which creates and addes a list of modules. One of these modules is
called `ClusterModule` and it contains the deciders. So the whole logic happens
at the early stage of the lifecycle, more precisely, the creation happens before the
startup of a node.

```yml
- boostrap
  - construct node
    - create modules
      - create master module
        - create deciders
        - create root decider (AllocationDeciders)
        - create allocation service
        - ...
    - add modules
  - start node
```

## Testing

* How are they tested?

## Going Further

How to go further from here?

TODO:

* Who asks the node the make decisions? Does every node participate to the
  decision or only one node handles everything for the cluster?
