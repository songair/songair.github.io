## Introduction

Today I would like to discuss audit logs with you. Audit logs are logs for
auditing. They are events that keep track of creation, modification, deletion,
or any other operation that mutates the state of a given resource. This resource
can be a database, a pipeline, or anything valuable for the company. You may
want to keep track of these events since they can be useful for security
analysis, troubleshooting, compliance, auditing, keeping track of the lifecycle
of a data-store, etc, depending on your role. During
my work at Datadog, I had the chance to implement a simple audit solution for an
internal tool. That's why I want to write down some thoughts and hopefully, they
will be useful for you as well.

After reading this article, you will understand:

* Requirements for audit logs
* Principles when implementing audit logs
* Focus deeper in Java solution using JAX-RS
* How to go further from this article

Now, let's get started!

## Requirements For Audit Logs

Generally speaking, there are some information that we care about:

- **Resource.** We want to know what is being accessed or modified. Therefore,
  we may want to record the resource ID, resource name, resource type, resource
  group, or any other information related to this resource. Regarding to RESTful
  API, the resource ID can be the path, which is usually the representation of
  the resource.
- **Time.** We want to know when does this happen precisely. This is important
  to construct a timeline for a bigger event, like an incident, an attack, or
  the lifecycle of a resource.
- **Action.** We want to know what is being done on that resource. It provides
  an accurate description about the type of operation. Some typical examples are
  "create", "read", "delete", "update", etc.
- **User.** We want to know "who did that?" so that we can find out more
  information based on that user or better understand the motiviation of this
  operation. The user information may contain: the first name, last name, email,
  department, organization unit, employee ID, etc.

We can eventually go further by adding more metadata to faciliate the search,
making the description more human readable, etc. But I believe that these are not
requirements, but enhancements to make the feature more usable.

Then on the business side, there are other also some requirements:

- **Retention.** The retention of the audit logs. We want them to store longer
  than normal logs because they are specific logs for investigation. These are
  precious events helping us to redraw the big picture.
- **Access**. Perhaps not everyone should be accessed to audit logs. Taking
  Datadog's product ["Audit
  Logs"](https://docs.datadoghq.com/fr/account_management/audit_logs/) as an
  example, only administrator or security team member can access Audit Logs. As
  an individual, you can only see a stream of your own actions.

I probably didn't cover everything in the section. If you have other ideas,
please let me know what you think in the comment section below.
