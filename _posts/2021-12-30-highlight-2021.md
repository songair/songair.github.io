## Introduction

Writing an article to review the whole year becomes a tradition for me. After
writing a review for 5 consecutive years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020), I decided to
continue this practice this year, to share with you my journey in the tech
industry as a software engineer at Datadog and other side-projects that I did
during my free time. Hopefully, they will let you learn something or inspire
you to create your story.
Now, let's get started!

## Datadog

I joined Datadog at the end of 2019 as a software engineer working for the Event
Platform. Event Platform ingests trillions of events per day for 30+ products:
Logs, APM, Profiling, Real User Monitoring (RUM), Security Analytics, Error
Tracking, Network Monitoring, and more. This year, I kept working on the storage
part of the platform, developping new solutions to ensure the data reliability,
reducing costs, and reduce operational work for other engineers.
Since the platform grew fast, having manual operations became
more and more painful. Operating the a large-scale system without dedicated
operations engineers and site-reliablity engineers (SRE) became very challenging.
What's why a new team called "Event Platform Automation" was created. And I have
the privilege to be part of this team since October 2021. The goal is to improve operability of the system by
automating repetitive tasks using workflows, simplifying the configuration and
code structure, providing verifications, and making the administration UI more
consistent.


**Indexold.** Indexold is a custom solution for data lifecycle management. It is
a state-machine which manages the lifecycle of the data once they are stored in
our system. Similar to Elasticsearch's [Index Lifecycle Management
(ILM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/overview-index-lifecycle-management.html),
it allows to move data from compution-intensive machines to storage-friendly
machines. It allows storing historical data in a cost efficient way, making
operations easy, having control about the data placement, and resilient to node
failures. The development of this project last over 3 quarters and we have about
3 engineers working on it at full time. I mainly participated to: storage
optimization, re-snapshotting, data deletion, rollout to production (AWS, GCP,
Azure), and maintenance.

**Automation (workflows).**
