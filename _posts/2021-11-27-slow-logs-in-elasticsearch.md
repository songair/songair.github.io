## Introduction

If you are using Elasticsearch in production, you are probably familiar with
slow logs. Slow logs are logs provided by Elasticsearch, which help you to
troubleshoot the slowness of the write path (index) or the read path
(search). It's useful for determinating the root cause of the problem and may
provide hints to mitigations and solutions. In this article, I want to discuss
slow logs with you, in particular:

* How does the log look like?
* How to change thresholds?
* Some specific concepts to dig deeper
* How to go further from this article

Now, let's get started!

## Query Slow Log

Let's analyze a slow log provided Elasticsearch official documentation ([link](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-slowlog.html)):

> [2030-08-30T11:59:37,786][WARN ][i.s.s.query              ] [node-0] [index6][0]
> took[78.4micros], took_millis[0], total_hits[0 hits], stats[],
> search_type[QUERY_THEN_FETCH], total_shards[1],
> source[{"query":{"match_all":{"boost":1.0}}}], id[MY_USER_ID],

If we split the log into pieces, we can obtain the following table:

Field | Value | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
Timestamp | 2030-08-30T11:59:37,786 | The timestamp of the log.
Log Level | WARN | It means that the query execution time is higher than the query "warn" threshold. This is configured in index settings API.
Logger | i.s.s.query | This is a concise version of logger name (class name): "index.search.slowlog.query". This is useful for use to determine the type of the slowness: index or search.
Node | node-0 | It means that the slowness happens on node-0. If you select a time range and group by nodes, it will help you the determine the distribution of the slowness cross the cluster. In other words, determine if the slowness happens on one single node or happens on multiple ones. Also, if you name the node with some special meaning, e.g. roles (fresh, warm, cold), you will be able to determine which roles are slow.
Index name | index6 | The name of the index that is impacted. We have similar troubleshooting ideas as "node" mentioned above. Additionally, you may have the customer's id, product type, timestamp, or other useful information as part of the index names. Therefore, it's useful for you to determine which customer, which product, or which range of indices are impacted.
Shard | 0 | The shard id.
Took | 78.4micros | Execution time in humain readable format. It determines how slow the query is.
Took in milliseconds | 0 | Execution time in milliseconds in numeric value. If you have the possibility to transform this value in your log pipelines, you can calculate filter the queries that are slower than certain threshold, e.g. ">= 2 seconds". Therefore, you can reduce noises and better indentify the source of the problem. This transformation can be done using a grok parser. Here is a great beginner's guide about [Logstash Grok](https://logz.io/blog/logstash-grok/) and here is the documentation of [Grok Parser in Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/processors/).
Stats | | Statistics
Search type | QUERY_THEN_FETCH | The type of search.
Total shards | 1 | Total number of shards.
Source | { "query": { "match_all": { "boost ": 1.0 } } } | The source of of the query. This is one of the most important fields. It allows us the determine how the query looks like and gives us an idea of what kind of information that the user is looking for.
ID | MY_USER_ID | The user ID. It may help you determine whether the query problems come from the same user.

## Thresholds

You can use thresholds to better define the level of logs depending on your requirements. Note that these settings are dynamic so you can change them without restarting the server. The 3 different kinds of thresholds that you can define are: index (`index`), the query phase of search (`query`), and the fetch phase of the search (`fetch`).

```
PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
{
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn": "10s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info": "5s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug": "2s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.trace": "500ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn": "1s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.info": "800ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug": "500ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.trace": "200ms"
}
```

... but what is query-then-fetch?

According to "Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide", there are two phases in the search: query and fetch.

* **query**: during the initial query phase, the query is broadcast to a shard copy (a primary or replica shard) of every shard in the index. Each shard executes the search locally and builds a priority queue of matching documents. It identifies which documents satisfy the search request.
* **fetch**: we retrieve the documents themselves.

For more details, you can visit ["Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide 2.x"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html), especially the ["Query Phase"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_query_phase.html) and the ["Fetch Phase"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_fetch_phase.html).
